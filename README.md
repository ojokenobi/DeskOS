# DeskOS
Simple desktop "replacement" software created in Python

Please make sure that your monitor is set to a resolution of 1920 x 1080 as
this application does not yet have dynamic scaling, so everything will
be off centered and possibly not visible depending on resolution. To access all
the editors and features of DeskOS, use the top left hand button of the main 
window.
